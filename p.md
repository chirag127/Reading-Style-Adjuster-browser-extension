Product Requirements Document: "Reading Style" Adjuster

Version: 1.0
Date: October 26, 2023
Author: [Your Name/Team]
Status: Final

1. Introduction

1.1. Overview: The "Reading Style" Adjuster is a browser extension that empowers users to personalize and standardize the appearance of text content across websites. It provides granular control over key typographic properties like font size, font family, line height, word spacing, and text justification, applying these preferences globally or with specific overrides.

1.2. Problem: Reading text online can be inconsistent and uncomfortable due to varying website designs, font choices, and lack of user control. This can negatively impact readability, accessibility (especially for users with visual impairments or dyslexia), and overall browsing satisfaction.

1.3. Goal: To provide users with a seamless, powerful, and intuitive tool to create their optimal reading environment across the web, enhancing readability, accessibility, and comfort.

1.4. Vision: Become the standard tool for users seeking complete control over their web text reading experience, promoting accessibility and personalized browsing.

2. Goals

2.1. User Empowerment: Enable users to define and apply their preferred text styles universally.

2.2. Enhanced Readability: Improve text clarity and reduce eye strain during prolonged reading sessions.

2.3. Increased Accessibility: Offer crucial customization options for users with dyslexia, low vision, or other reading challenges.

2.4. Consistency: Create a uniform reading experience regardless of the underlying website's design choices.

2.5. Ease of Use: Provide an intuitive interface for managing complex style adjustments.

2.6. Performance: Operate efficiently without noticeably impacting browser performance or page load times.

3. Target Audience

3.1. Primary:

Users with visual impairments (e.g., low vision).

Users with reading disabilities (e.g., dyslexia).

Users sensitive to specific font styles, sizes, or spacing (e.g., due to migraines, Irlen Syndrome).

3.2. Secondary:

Avid readers who spend significant time consuming text online.

Power users who desire fine-grained control over their browsing environment.

Users seeking a more consistent and comfortable visual experience across websites.

Web developers/designers testing readability variations.

4. Functional Requirements

4.1. Core Style Adjustments (Global Application):

4.1.1. Font Size: Allow users to set a specific font size (e.g., in pixels or ems) or adjust relative size (e.g., +/- percentage). Must override website-defined font sizes for primary text content.

4.1.2. Font Family:

Allow selection from a curated list of common web-safe fonts (e.g., Arial, Verdana, Times New Roman, Georgia, Courier New).

Include specific dyslexia-friendly fonts (e.g., OpenDyslexic, Lexend).

Allow users to input the name of any font installed on their system. The extension must gracefully handle cases where the specified font is not available (fall back to a default or user-defined fallback).

4.1.3. Line Height (Leading): Allow users to set a specific line height (e.g., unitless multiplier like 1.5, percentage, or pixels).

4.1.4. Word Spacing: Allow users to adjust the space between words (e.g., in pixels or ems).

4.1.5. Text Justification: Allow users to force text alignment: Left, Right, Center, or Justify. Must override website defaults.

4.2. Control & Activation:

4.2.1. Popup Interface: The primary user interface will be accessed via the browser extension toolbar icon. This popup will contain controls for all style adjustments.

4.2.2. Global Enable/Disable: A master toggle switch within the popup to quickly enable or disable all custom style adjustments across all websites. The extension icon should visually indicate the current state (enabled/disabled).

4.2.3. Real-time Application: Changes made in the popup UI should reflect (near) instantly on the currently active tab for immediate feedback.

4.2.4. Persistence: All user-defined settings (global styles, profiles, exceptions) must be saved locally and persist across browser sessions.

4.3. Profiles & Presets:

4.3.1. Default Profile: The extension ships with a default, non-intrusive setting.

4.3.2. User-Defined Profiles: Allow users to save multiple sets of style configurations as named profiles (e.g., "Day Reading," "Night Mode," "Dyslexia Assist").

4.3.3. Profile Switching: Allow easy switching between saved profiles via the popup UI.

4.3.4. Profile Management: Allow users to create, rename, update, and delete profiles.

4.4. Per-Site Settings & Exceptions:

4.4.1. Domain-Specific Overrides: Allow users to disable the extension entirely for specific domains (e.g., google.docs.com) where custom styling might break functionality.

4.4.2. Domain-Specific Profiles: Allow users to assign a specific saved profile to a particular domain, overriding the global settings for that site.

4.4.3. Management Interface: Provide a dedicated section (potentially in an options page or a separate tab in the popup) to manage domain exceptions and assignments.

4.5. Settings Management:

4.5.1. Reset to Defaults: Provide options to reset:

Current settings to the active profile's defaults.

Active profile to extension defaults.

All extension settings (including profiles and exceptions) to factory defaults.

4.5.2. Import/Export: Allow users to export their settings (including all profiles and exceptions) to a file (e.g., JSON) and import settings from such a file. This facilitates backup and sharing.

4.6. Content Targeting:

4.6.1. Intelligent Application: The extension must intelligently apply styles primarily to the main textual content blocks of a webpage (e.g., paragraphs, lists, articles) while minimizing disruption to UI elements (buttons, navigation menus, input fields), code blocks, or preformatted text where original formatting is crucial. This requires sophisticated CSS selector logic or DOM analysis.

4.6.2. Handling Dynamic Content: Styles must be applied correctly even on pages that load content dynamically (e.g., single-page applications, infinite scroll) using techniques like MutationObserver.

5. Non-Functional Requirements

5.1. Performance:

5.1.1. Page Load Impact: The extension must add minimal overhead to page load times. Style injection and DOM manipulation should be highly optimized.

5.1.2. CPU/Memory Usage: Background processes and content scripts must be resource-efficient, avoiding excessive CPU or memory consumption.

5.2. Compatibility:

5.2.1. Browser Support: Must function correctly on the latest stable versions of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.

5.2.2. Website Compatibility: Must function effectively across a wide range of websites, including complex web applications, news sites, blogs, and forums. Graceful degradation should occur on incompatible sites (ideally, styles simply don't apply rather than breaking the page).

5.2.3. Extension Conflicts: Minimize potential conflicts with other popular browser extensions (especially those manipulating page styles or accessibility tools).

5.3. Usability:

5.3.1. Intuitiveness: The popup UI and any options pages must be easy to understand and navigate. Controls should be clearly labeled.

5.3.2. Feedback: Provide clear visual feedback for user actions (e.g., confirmation of profile save, indication of active state).

5.3.3. Accessibility (WCAG): The extension's own UI (popup, options page) must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards, including keyboard navigability and screen reader compatibility.

5.4. Security:

5.4.1. Permissions: Request only the minimum necessary permissions required for functionality (likely storage, scripting, potentially activeTab). Justify each permission.

5.4.2. Data Handling: All user settings and profiles are stored locally using chrome.storage.local. No user data, browsing history, or personal information is transmitted to any external server.

5.5. Reliability:

5.5.1. Consistency: Applied styles should be consistent across compatible websites and browser sessions.

5.5.2. Stability: The extension should be stable and not prone to crashing or causing browser instability.

5.6. Maintainability:

5.6.1. Modular Codebase: Code must be organized logically into modules (see Technical Specifications) with clear responsibilities.

5.6.2. Code Quality: Code should be well-commented, follow consistent coding standards, and be reasonably easy to debug and update.

6. Design & UX Considerations

6.1. Popup UI: Clean, uncluttered design. Use standard controls like sliders (for size/spacing), dropdowns (for fonts/justification), and toggles. Include a small preview area showing sample text rendered with the current settings.

6.2. Iconography: Use a clear extension icon. Consider changing the icon state (e.g., color, badge) to indicate whether styles are currently active on the page or globally disabled.

6.3. Options Page (Optional but Recommended): For managing profiles and site exceptions, a dedicated options page might offer a better user experience than cramming everything into the popup.

6.4. Onboarding: Consider a brief first-run introduction or tooltip explaining the basic functionality.

7. Technical Specifications

7.1. Platform: Browser Extension (Manifest V3).

7.2. Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+). No mandatory framework, but small libraries for UI elements could be considered if they significantly improve development speed and UX without adding bloat.

7.3. Backend: No backend server is required or permitted for this core functionality. All operations are client-side within the browser.

7.4. APIs:

chrome.storage.local: For persisting all user settings, profiles, and exceptions.

chrome.scripting: For programmatically injecting CSS and executing content scripts into webpages.

chrome.tabs: To query active tabs and potentially trigger updates.

chrome.runtime: For message passing between service worker, popup, and content scripts.

MutationObserver (in content scripts): To detect and handle dynamically loaded content.

7.5. Permissions:

storage: Essential for saving user settings.

scripting: Essential for modifying webpage styles via content scripts. Requires host permissions (likely <all_urls> for global application, clearly justified in store listing).

activeTab (Optional): Could potentially be used for initial interaction or applying styles only on explicit user action, but scripting with host permissions is likely necessary for automatic global application.

fontSettings (Investigate): If reading/writing browser-level font settings is desired/possible, this permission might be needed, but focus first on CSS overrides.

7.7. Style Injection Method: Primarily use chrome.scripting.insertCSS to inject dynamically generated CSS rules based on user settings. Avoid excessive use of inline styles directly on elements where possible, favouring targeted CSS rules for better performance and manageability. Use high specificity or !important judiciously and only where necessary to override website styles reliably.

8. Data & Privacy

8.1. Data Collection: The extension does not collect, store, or transmit any user browsing history, personal data, or website content.

8.2. Data Storage: All user-defined settings (style preferences, profiles, site exceptions) are stored exclusively on the user's local machine using the browser's chrome.storage.local API.

8.3. Privacy Policy: A clear and concise privacy policy must be provided, stating the above points, accessible from the extension's options or store listing.

9. Release Criteria

9.1. Functionality: All functional requirements (Section 4) are implemented and pass testing.

9.2. Performance: Meets defined performance targets for page load impact and resource usage (Section 5.1).

9.3. Compatibility: Tested and verified on the target browsers and a representative sample of diverse, high-traffic websites (Section 5.2).

9.4. Stability & Reliability: No known critical or major bugs. Settings apply consistently.

9.5. Usability: UI is intuitive, accessible (meets WCAG 2.1 AA), and provides adequate feedback.

9.6. Security & Privacy: Permissions are minimized and justified. No data leakage. Privacy policy is accurate and available.
